### Author: Kylie Newcomer

This repository contains the materials for the environmental justice homework assignment for **EDS 223 Geospatial Analysis and Remote Sensing**. Materials for this assignment can be found on the [course website](https://eds-223-geospatial.github.io/).

## Data

Data is from the United States Environmental Protection Agency's EJScreen: Environmental Justice Screening and Mapping Tool, which is no longer available, but can be downloaded from [this Google Drive link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nG6Nj1bXfzQFOVMO8Km3eNy4SWu1YcIQ/view).

## Workflow

The EJScreen data was filtered to the Inland Empire (Riverside and San Bernardino County) in Southern California. Data was mutated to create variables looking at the estimated number of children under 5 years old living in poverty and in home with lead paint by multiplying the number of children by the poverty andf lead paint home percentages. Maps displaying these factors across the two counties were made using `tmap()`.
