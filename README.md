## Data

Data is from the United States Environmental Protection Agency's EJScreen: Environmental Justice Screening and Mapping Tool, which is no longer available, but can be downloaded from [this Google Drive link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nG6Nj1bXfzQFOVMO8Km3eNy4SWu1YcIQ/view).

## Workflow

The EJScreen data was filtered to the Inland Empire (Riverside and San Bernardino County) in Southern California. Maps displaying the percent of low income households and particulate matter 2.5 across the two counties were made using `tmap()`.
